# ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY

This repository contains my works that I've implemented so far. <br> 
Based on which programming language I used, I arranged my works in three-fold - 1) Java, 2) Python, 3) R. <br>

# Java
The repository 'Java' contains my solutions to assignments of the courses CS101 (INTRO TO CS), CS102 (DATA STRUCTURE). I am happy to share my solutions as I really enjoyed learning OOP, which allowed me to change my perspective on programming. <br>

# Python
The repository 'Python' contains my solutions to assignments of the courses INTRO TO ML, CS231n. <br> I implemented various models from SVM to GANs using scikit-learn, PyTorch, and Tensorflow. Both courses provided skeletons of how to implement models. <br>

# R
The repository 'R' contains my works on models in Econometrics and Bayesian statistics. <br> 
I also put some codes that I worked on to clean a dataset so that you can see what type of projects I've done in the past. <br>
I believe that you can find my knowledge and experience on statistical analysis and data processing. <br>
However, note that all these codes were written before I learned cs courses, so it may seem a little bit of brute force (e.g., overuse of for loop or inefficient and dirty codes). <br>


Thanks :)
